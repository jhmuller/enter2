<p class="p-center">
Welcome to Enter The Data. <br>
 (<em>Enter</em> as in <em>step into and explore</em>) </p>
<br><br>
I am a computer scientist, a data scientist and a finance quant.
<br><br>
I like to solve practical problems and create useful applications.
 I love doing  analytics, machine learning, algorithms and data science,
 so I am thrilled that these disciplines have all become very popular and that just about
 every industry is using their methods to solve problems. <br><br>
It means more fun and rewarding opportunities for me.
<br> <br>
I would also like to think it also means something positive for us all in general.
