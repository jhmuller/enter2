I am a computer scientist by training but in my professional life Iâ€™ve also played the part of  a mathematician,
 electrical engineer, finance quant and data scientist.

I like to solve practical problems and create useful applications.
 I love doing  analytics, machine learning, algorithms and data science,
 so I am thrilled that these disciplines have all become very popular and that just about
 every industry is using their methods to solve problems.
It means more fun and rewarding opportunities for me
but I would also like to think it also means something positive for us all in general.
